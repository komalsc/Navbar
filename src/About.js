      <h2>We help you break the glass ceiling which blocks entry to tech.
We are a team of IIT / ISB alumni who are passionate about solving the key problem of starting a career in tech. A lot of smart and hardworking graduates find it difficult to crack high paying tech jobs either because of their background and their college not being able to help them get interviews. Hence, we started this placement bootcamp that hand holds people from skilling till employment.</h2>
